I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Sociology of Princeton University. My advisor is [Matthew Salganik](https://www.princeton.edu/~mjs3/). 
I obtained my B.S. in Computer Science and B.A. in History, 2013, from Peking University.

My research spans computational social science, social movements, and quantitative methods.
My dissertation identifies, describes and explains political protests in China using social media data. Datasets about protest events in authoritarian have been scant. In the first chapter of my dissertation, I use the state-of-art deep learning methods with both image and text data to identify 200,000 offline collective action events in China from 2011 - 2017 from 9.5 Million Weibo (Chinese Twitter) posts. With this unique dataset, the second chapter of my dissertation characterizes the prevalence, trends, geographical distribution, issues, tactics of the protests in China and their interaction with the police. The third chapter of my dissertation then explains why some grievances in China turned out to be protests and others fail, by comparing matched cases of grievance, some of which became protests and others remained as grievances.
